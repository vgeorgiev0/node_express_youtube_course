The Last Cupcake

Sarah stared at the last chocolate cupcake in the bakery display. It was 4:59 PM, and the shop was about to close. Her mouth watered as she counted the coins in her pocket - just enough. As she reached for her wallet, an elderly woman walked in.

"Oh dear," the woman sighed, "I promised my granddaughter a chocolate cupcake for her birthday today, but I got caught up at work."

Without hesitation, Sarah smiled and pointed to the last cupcake. "Please, take it. I was just looking."

The woman's eyes lit up with gratitude. As Sarah walked out, the baker called her back and handed her two fresh vanilla cupcakes, still warm from the oven.

"For your kindness," he winked.

Sometimes the best treats aren't the ones we originally wanted.
